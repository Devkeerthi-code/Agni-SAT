# Agni-SAT
Code for my first project AgniSAT with collabrations from IISC Bangalore. This is the solution to Global warming
In Hindi Agni means fire and SAT in English means satellite.

Now let me give you another perspective just to this name. In Sanskrint Agni is fire - which is known to be the purifier of all whereas the word SAT means bliss. When you combine both - AgniSAT. the purifier who will grant bliss to the world

A few years back came out a fact : that the ever giving Mother Earth has reached capacity and will no longer be able to replenish for our needs today if we do not act, we will not see tomorrow. This is what AgniSAT does now the wait is up for Mother Earth to reach her state of bliss after all her fortitude.

This is where AgniSAT comes into play -
A satellite designed for a specific purpose: to mitigate global warming. As paradoxical as it may seem, it's indeed true, and that's precisely why we require this solution However, my effort remains incomplete
without your contribution to Mother Earth and that's the purpose behind creating this initiative - AgniSAT
